        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a first year at UCR studying Pre Business hoping to get a concentration in Marketing. I have worked as an Umpire at a local Softball league near my hometown. I have also worked at Vitality Bowl. My ultimate goal is to work in Marketing or Public Relations and living in Barcelona, Spain. I have been around Business my entire life. As a young girl, my father has always involved and taught me about his businesses. He started creating business at 17 is now 52 doing the same thing. Currently he is in the ecommerce world as well as genetically identifying cannabis plants. My father has influenced me into getting into the business world. He is truly an inspiration and has inspired me to pursue this career. Further he is a computer science geek and loves that I am in this class. Whether or not I learn anything in this class, well he doesn't have to know does he. I am really just trying to make the work count at the moment so I don't know what to say. I hope you enjoy reading a little story. Little Red Riding hood is a funny story because no wolf can talk or pretend to be a grandma. So it just seems off to me.  <br><br>

        I was born in Barcelona, Spain and moved to California at the age of 5. I am fluent in 3 languages: Spanish, Catalan, and English. I adapt to new enviorments very quickly as I have been moving around my entire life. I am quick to learn with new equipment and technology. I have played many sports throughout my upbringing. I started out doing swim and then I did soccer. I found softball and stuck to that for a couple of years. I was on my leagues travel team and even won nationals. I then went to Cheerleading and did that for 5 years. I became my schools cheer captain and was a 2 time national champion as well as a back to back CCS Champion. <br><br>

        Currently, I am involved with a couple organizations on my college campus. I am a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, which is a social sorority. We raise money towards mental health research and raise awareness for mental health. We further help our students with resources that can help people struggling from mental health. Kappa further interacts with other organizations on campus to help with their philanthropies. My upbringing in Barcelona as truly helped me become who I am today. My family back home is not too wealthy and I saw how hard my grandparents had to work to be where they are today. They were raised in the mists of the Spanish Civil War and had little to no money for food or any necessary item. They have never taken anything for granted. This mindset has been instilled in me and I have never taken anything for granted. I see how hard my parents work after seeing their parents work so hard.
